#### Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset
To me, having a growth mindset is understanding that knowledge is attainable with effort no matter one's previous experiences or natural ability. People with a growth mindset are like knowledge vacuums, inhaling any loose crumbs of information that could help them in the future.
