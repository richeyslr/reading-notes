#### Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset
To me, having a growth mindset is understanding that _knowledge is attainable with effort_ no matter one's previous experiences or natural ability. People with a growth mindset are like knowledge vacuums, inhaling any loose crumbs of information that could help them in the future.

#### Reminders for having Growth Mindset
1. Be prepared to face obstacles and have to take a break. A fresh set of eyes or a different perspective can spark creative juices.
2. The "hurt" is you putting in effort to gain the knowledge to help accomplish your goals!
3. Reflect on what you have learned or designed to better improve in the future. Reinforcing concepts and ideas makes them stick in your brain.
